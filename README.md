Project Goal: Email Automation for a Single User
You will create a Python script that can send an email to someone (like yourself or a friend) with a custom subject and message using your Gmail account

Demo Example
Suppose you want to send an email like this:
To: yourfriend@example.com
Subject: Meeting Reminder
Body:
Hi there,
Just reminding you about our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.
Regards,
Deepa
This script will send it automatically, instead of you opening Gmail manually every time.

Tools Needed:

Python installed on your system.
A Gmail account.
Enable Gmailâ€™s "App Password" (safer than using your real password).
